Play Module Template
====================

This is a small template for creating new Play2 Modules.

It is inspired from the [Article of Steve Chaloner]([http://www.objectify.be/wordpress/?p=363).

Note:
- There is no sample application, provide your own.
- You have to change "organisation", "appName" and "appVersion" inside project-code/project/Build.scala

Build it using `using play publishLocal` inside `project-code`
