Play Module Template
====================

This is a small template for creating new Play2 Modules.

It is inspired from the [Article of Steve Chaloner](http://www.objectify.be/wordpress/?p=363).

Note:
- There is no sample application, provide your own.
- You have to change "organisation", "appName" and "appVersion" inside project-code/project/Build.scala
- You are free to rename the `project-code` directory. This is just the starting point where to put in your library code. IntelliJ is using the name of this directory as the project name

Build it using `using play publishLocal` inside `project-code`
